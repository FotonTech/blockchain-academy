# Blockchain Academy

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a shortcut for people who are interested in learning about blockchain to more easily find _free quality content_ on the subject. We will divide it into **three sections**; in the first one, [Basics](#basics), we will cover the basic concept of blockchain. After that, in [Common Blockchains](#common-blockchains), we'll delve deeper into blockchains that are most present in real-life projects that customers ask for. Lastly, we will have [Code](#code) content and tutorials, to develop better programming skills in blockchain context. We will also have a section where people who want to be [Mentors](#mentors) make their contacts available to answer questions from those who have them.    

Feel free to suggest or create PRs with changes and additions, as well as open discussions in the issues section.
